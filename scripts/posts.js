"summary":`Shoe admits to being a nibbler`,
"post":`Reading my favourite language blog* just now, I came upon the delightful phrase <i>"nibbled to death by ducks"</i>. This not so very unpleasant-sounding demise is said to be suffered by anyone whose writing has the nits picked out of it by a self-appointed guardian of the language.  In the blog I was reading the capital punishment was meted out to someone who had perpetrated the crime of mid-sentence person shifting; e.g. If <i>one</i> lives in a glass house,  <i>you</i> shouldn't throw stones.|I apologize to anyone who has been peckled to an untimely end in these blogs, but I can't promise to renounce this addictive hobby.|* <a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/" target="_blank">http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/</a>`

"title":`carminative`,
"summary":`Shoe reveals one of his favourite passages in English literature`,
"post":`The source of an idea for a new posting to this journal is sometimes convoluted - as in this case. I was sorting through some old videos with a view to chucking most of them away, when I came on an episode from Fawlty Towers. I can't remember the name of the episode but it was about betting on a horse. My favourite bit comes when Fawlty tries to get the doddery old colonel to remember where he put the money Fawlty gave him. After about 5 minutes of ever more menacing pleading and cajoling by Fawlty, the colonel says: <i>What was the question again?</i> It's brilliant, and it always reminds me of an equally brilliant passage in Aldous Huxley's <i>Chrome Yellow</i>. |Of course Huxley was writing long before the advent of web journals, but I like to think that the passage would have fitted perfectly into a blog like this about language and culture. It is a wonderful, wonderful reflection on the dissonance between the sound of a word (<i>carminative</i>) and its meaning. I won't spoil things by saying what <i>carminative</i> means but I can heartily recommend reading the <a href="" class=show target="blank">original text</a>. The reason that I was reminded by Fawlty Towers about the Huxley passage is that it takes the speaker (Denis) about 5 minutes before he finally reveals the meaning of the word to his polite but increasingly impatient listener (Mr Scogan).| Ok, the connection between Huxley and Fawlty is a little tenuous, but I thought it was a good excuse to make reference to one of my favourite passages in English literature!`

"title":`Schadenfreude`,
"summary":`a useful German word`,
"post":`According to my encyclopedia of language English has over 500,000 words compared to German's meagre 190,000. Even so, English occasionally steals a German word when it doesn't have a good one of its own to express an idea - <i>Schadenfreude</i> is a perfect example, not to mention <i>Gem&uuml;tlichkeit</i> or <i>Blitzkrieg</i> or <i>Weltschmerz</i>. These are all typically big German words but there's also a little one that English could do with importing. Before I give the game away, imagine this common dialogue from the math classroom:<ul class=li><li class=li>Teacher: You haven't done your homework, have you?<li class=li>Student: No.</ul> So what does the student mean? Well, if the student is a native speaker of English, <i>No</i> spoken with falling intonation will mean <i>Yes, you're right. I haven't done my homework.</i> But an ESL student saying <i>No</i> would probably intend: <i>No, you're wrong. I have done my homework!</i>|What English needs is a single word that contradicts a false assumption. Presently you need a whole string of words to do so, as in <i>You didn't feed the cat! - You're wrong. I did indeed feed the cat!</i> or <i>You're not going out dressed like that! - You're too right I'm going out dressed like this and just you try to stop me!</i> |Well, German has such a word - <i>doch</i>. And it can even be used in response to statements where the listener detects an element of surprise or doubt in the speaker's tone; e.g. <i>You like Volksmusik! - Yes, I like Volksmusik, and I resent your implication that there is something wrong with me for doing so!</i> For once German is much shorter: <i>Du magst Volksmusik!  - Doch!</i>`

"title":`surreal banter`,
"summary":`the Shoe makes an F-move`,
"post":`I was browsing the online table of contents of the English Language Teaching Journal to see if anything interesting had been posted since I last logged in. A title that caught my eye was <i>Supportive teacher talk: the importance of the F-move</i>. I was momentarily distracted by a consideration as to whether <i>supportive</i> was intended to modify <i>teacher</i> or <i>talk</i>, but quickly alighted on the <i>F-move</i>. This vaguely suspect term refers apparently to the <i>F</i> in <i>I-R-F</i>, which is the standard language classroom teacher/student interaction pattern that goes: <i>Initiate</i> (teacher) - <i>Response</i> (student) - <i>Follow-up</i> (teacher).|In other words, the teacher asks a question, the student answers it and the teacher gives feedback. For example: <ul class=li><li class=li>[<b>I</b>]  What did you do after school yesterday?<li class=li>[<b>R</b>]  I didn't do anything. <li class=li>[<b>F</b>]  Good!</ul>In such an exchange <i>Good</i> does not mean of course that the teacher thinks it's good that the student didn't do anything. No, <i>good</i> indicates to the student that her answer is grammatically correct. This kind of surreal banter, totally lacking in any pretence at authentic communication, has rightly come in for a bit of a hammering in recent years, due in no small part to the following, hopefully apocryphal, exchange: <ul class=li><li class=li>[<b>I</b>] What did you do after school yesterday?<li class=li>[<b>R</b>] My cat died.<li class=li>[<b>F</b>] Good! </ul>But this got me thinking about applying I-R-F to marital exchanges. After all, there's nothing spouses enjoy more than being corrected by their other half!<ul class=li><li class=li>[<b>I</b>] Have you fed the cat? <li class=li>[<b>R</b>] No, I've decided to let it starve to death. <li class=li>[<b>F</b>] Good! </ul><ul class=li><li class=li>[<b>I</b>] Phone! <li class=li>[<b>R</b>] Could you answer it?  I'm on the toilet. <li class=li>[<b>F</b>] Well done! </ul><ul class=li><li class=li>[<b>I</b>] Are you going to be much longer? <li class=li>[<b>R</b>] I haven't even washed my hair yet so I won't be ready for another two hours at least. <li class=li>[<b>F</b>] Great, no mistakes! </ul><ul class=li><li class=li>[<b>I</b>] Have you finished with the paper? <li class=li>[<b>R</b>] Yes. <li class=li>[<b>F</b>] Full sentence answer please.</ul><ul class=li><li class=li>[<b>I</b>] I've just invested all our savings in swindle.dot.com <li class=li>[<b>R</b>] You're even stupider than you look. <li class=li>[<b>F</b>] What did I tell you about the comparative of 2-syllable adjectives?</ul><ul class=li><li class=li>[<b>I</b>] Who was that on the phone?<li class=li>[<b>R</b>] My mother. She said she's going to come and stay with us for a few months.<li class=li>[<b>F</b>] Almost right, but remember, we normally change the tense of the verb in the subordinate clause of reported speech.</ul><ul class=li><li class=li>[<b>I</b>] When is your birthday?<li class=li>[<b>R</b>] How many year's have we been married and you still dont remember when my birthday is!<li class=li>[<b>F</b>] Do this worksheet and be ready for a test on apostrophe use tomorrow.</ul>|OK. Enough already - and I don't advise trying this at home.`

"title":`mangled English`,
"summary":`wonderful instructions on how to wear a bike helmet`,
"post":`ESL teachers, or this one at least, have a keen eye for the mangling of the English language - i.e. they're pedants. Hardly a day goes by without them coming them across words or expressions that allow them to indulge in their favourite hobby. One of the best hunting grounds for mangled English are the instruction manuals that come with products such as mobile phones or cameras. It never ceases to amaze me how often the translation from Japanese or German is completely botched. How difficult would it be to ask a native English speaker to run a quick eye over the translation before the manual is published? But there again, maybe they don't expect anyone to actually read the stuff. |My favourite mangling is from the instruction booklet that came with a bike helmet I bought recently. The manufacturer is Abus - one of the Germany's largest producers of security devices, such as locks and alarm systems. So hardly a one-man company with no access to an English native speaker! You might wonder why you would need instruction in how to wear a bike helmet, but here are some gems: <ul class=li><li class=li>Do not pull the helmet over the forehead for not reducing the visibility. <li class=li>Helmets are available in two shell sizes, whereat the helmets of one size can be adjusted to the personal head size.<li class=li>These different sizes refer to one's head size which can be measured by one width of a finger above the eyebrows. <li class=li>Fit waistbands always properly. <li class=li>Never leave helmet behind panes, for examples in the car (effect of burning glass).<li class=li>If the helmet was pushed strongly, the protective effect can be reduced relevantly even without any visible indication.</UL>Wonderful!`

"title":`First post`,
"summary":`introduction to this blog`,
"post":`Practise what you preach seems to be a good motto for a teacher. Since I, an ESL teacher at an international school in Germany, ask my students to write a regular journal, it does not seem unreasonable for them to expect me to do the same. |So here it is. The first burning question of course, is: To be or not to be .. anonymous? And the answer, as in many cases, is: Yes and no. So yes, my name and the school I work at are not stated. But no, there aren't too many international schools in Germany, and with my blog title, it wouldn't need a Sherlock Holmes to track me down. 
So why not be upfront? Well, although most of the blogs will be about language or German culture, I do want to reserve the right from time to time to be a little critical of some of the things that I experience in my day-to-day work at the school.| On the other hand I have no intention of overtly fouling the nest. Suffice to say that the school, despite the inevitable irritations, is a great place to work at and has, by and large, happy, healthy and successful students. I have worked there for more than 20 years and hope to do so until I retire.
The blog 150 or so blog entries that follow have already been written and will be added one at a time at regular intervals until I bring myself up-to-date. They will then become much more sporadic.`
