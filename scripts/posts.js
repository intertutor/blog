"post":"I like to get feedback from my students at the end of the first term, so I ask them to fill out a survey with questions about their ESL class. For example I ask them their opinions about the topics covered, homework, tests, using the computer etc. It's gratifying when most students seem happy with what and how they've been taught (or just don't care enough to write comments to the contrary!) But just as you are basking in a self-satisfied  glow, you get to the last questionnaire, which conveys the student's dislike for everything about the class, including the ridiculous clothes you wear. <br /><br /> Oh well, it keeps you honest, as my American friends would say!"

        "post":"I love idioms. The most innocuous and everyday words can combine to make language that is completely impenetrable to non-native speakers. I remember an assembly in which the principal harangued the students on account of a collective lethargy that had set in. <i>You'd better start pulling your socks up!</i> she admonished. On another occasion I confused a student who had shown me a history text that she was supposed to read. <i>This is very difficult</i>, she said. My less than helpful reply was, <i>You can say that again!</i><br /><br />In fact, it's important to sensitize ESL students to this very common feature of colloquial language - otherwise they don't understand why they don't understand.  For this reason I often throw in idioms such as <i>Put a sock in it! Can you give me a hand! Cut that out!</i> or <i>That really gets my goat!   Your work is going to the dogs</i>; and get students to decipher what they mean.<br /><br />Of course, most idioms are fairly rigid and this makes them still more difficult to use correctly than to understand. Students have to learn how risible even the smallest of changes sound to a native speaker: <i>Put a sock on it! Can you give me the hand? Cut out that! That really gets my coat. Your work is going to the dog!</i>"
